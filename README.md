# Flashcards
Flashcard program that loads a dictionary object from file in same directory as executed python program

''' At a high level, I wanted a tool to help me learn my wife's Bisaya dialect, but her dialect is not the main dialect of the Philippines so resources to help learn it are not as prevalent as for the national Tagalog.
This is a language learning program that runs as a digital set of flash cards. It takes in a text file with a dictionary object, with the keys being the english words and the values being the bisaya as list objects. 

I'll be uploading the bisaya word lists as I go, so there will be ample examples if you want to create your own. The flashcards.py main file will work independently of languages, so as long as your dictionary object follows the required format it should load.
